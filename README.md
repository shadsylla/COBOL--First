# COBOL--First


COBOL is a pretty old language from 1959. Common Business Oriented Language. It's imperitive, procedural in nature. Until recently it didn't provide Objective Oriented programming. So why Am I spending hours on it? 
Intuition. That is my only explanation for now, until I figure out it will be useful in projects I really care about Like brain interface, Artificial Intelligence, and Space ships. 

One I know, My life is for moments like this when I follow my curiosity, that instrinsic feeling of progressing towards one direction. Taking the sets of actions that will make the future better.
